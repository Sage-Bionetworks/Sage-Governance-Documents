    court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court
    of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.

<p><strong>19.3 &nbsp;&nbsp; Opt-Out.</strong> If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding
    arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section 19
    (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration) within 30 days after the date
    that you agree to these Terms by sending a letter to Sage
    Bionetworks, Attention: Legal Department – Arbitration Opt-Out, 2901
    Third Ave, Ste 330, Seattle, WA 98121 that specifies: your full
    legal name, the email address associated with your account on the
    Service, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration
    (<span dir="rtl">“</span><ins><strong>Opt-Out Notice</strong></ins>”). Once Sage receives your
    Opt-Out Notice, this Section 19 (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration)
    will be void and any action arising out of these Terms will be
    resolved as set forth in Section 20.2 (Governing Law). The remaining
    provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out
    Notice.

<p><strong>19.4 &nbsp;&nbsp; Arbitrator.</strong> This arbitration agreement, and any arbitration
    between us, is subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and will be
    administered by JAMS under the rules applicable to consumer disputes
    (collectively, <span dir="rtl">“</span><ins><strong>JAMS Rules</strong></ins>”) as modified by
    these Terms. The JAMS Rules and filing forms are available online at
    www.jamsadr.org, by calling the JAMS at +1-800-352-5267, or by
    contacting Sage.

<p><strong>19.5 &nbsp;&nbsp; Commencing Arbitration.</strong> Before initiating arbitration, a party
    must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party
    by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required)
    or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical
    address, then by electronic mail (<span dir="rtl">“</span><ins><strong>Notice of
    Arbitration</strong></ins>”). Sage<span dir="rtl">’</span>s address for Notice is:
    <strong>Sage Bionetworks, 2901 Third Ave, Ste 330, Seattle, WA 98121, USA </strong>. The
    Notice of Arbitration must: (a) identify the name or account number
    of the party making the claim; (b) describe the nature and basis of
    the claim or dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought
    (<span dir="rtl">“</span><ins><strong>Demand</strong></ins>”). The parties will make good faith
    efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not
    reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of
    Arbitration is received, you or Sage may commence an arbitration
    proceeding. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these
    Terms, Sage will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee,
    unless your claim is for more than US$10,000 or if the Sage has
    received 25 or more similar demands for arbitration, in which case
    the payment of any fees will be decided by the JAMS Rules. If the
    arbitrator finds that either the substance of the claim or the
    relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper
    purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of
    Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be
    governed by the JAMS Rules and the other party may seek
    reimbursement for any fees paid to JAMS.</p>

<p><strong>19.6 &nbsp;&nbsp; Arbitration Proceedings.</strong> Any arbitration hearing will take place
    in the county and state of your residence unless we agree otherwise
    or, if the claim is for US$10,000 or less (and does not seek
    injunctive relief), you may choose whether the arbitration will be
    conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the
    arbitrator; (b) through a telephonic or video hearing; or (c) by an
    in-person hearing as established by the JAMS Rules in the county (or
    parish) of your residence. During the arbitration, the amount of any
    settlement offer made by you or Sage must not be disclosed to the
    arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and
    award, if any. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is
    conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision
    sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on
    which the decision and award, if any, are based.

<p><strong>19.7 &nbsp;&nbsp; Arbitration Relief.</strong> Except as provided in Section 19.8 (No Class
    Actions), the arbitrator can award any relief that would be
    available if the claims had been brought in a court of competent
    jurisdiction. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the
    last written settlement amount offered by Sage before an arbitrator
    was selected, Sage will pay to you the higher of: (a) the amount
    awarded by the arbitrator and (b) US$10,000. The
    arbitrator<span dir="rtl">’</span>s award shall be final and binding
    on all parties, except (1) for judicial review expressly permitted
    by law or (2) if the arbitrator<span dir="rtl">’</span>s award
    includes an award of injunctive relief against a party, in which
    case that party shall have the right to seek judicial review of the
    injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction that shall
    not be bound by the arbitrator<span dir="rtl">’</span>s application
    or conclusions of law. Judgment on the award may be entered in any
    court having jurisdiction.

<p><strong>19.8 &nbsp;&nbsp; No Class Actions.</strong> YOU AND SAGE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS
    AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS
    A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE
    PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Sage agree otherwise, the
    arbitrator may not consolidate more than one
    person<span dir="rtl">’</span>s claims, and may not otherwise
    preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>

<p><strong>19.9 &nbsp;&nbsp; Modifications to this Arbitration Provision.</strong> If Sage makes any
    substantive change to this arbitration provision, you may reject the
    change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to
    Sage<span dir="rtl">’</span>s address for Notice of Arbitration, in
    which case your account with Sage will be immediately terminated and
    this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the
    changes you rejected will survive.</p>

<p><strong>19.10 &nbsp;&nbsp; Enforceability.</strong> If Section 19.8 (No Class Actions) or the entirety
    of this Section 19 (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration) is found to
    be unenforceable, or if Sage receives an Opt-Out Notice from you,
    then the entirety of this Section 19 (Dispute Resolution and
    Arbitration) will be null and void and, in that case, the exclusive
    jurisdiction and venue described in Section 20.2 (Governing Law)
    will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.</p>
