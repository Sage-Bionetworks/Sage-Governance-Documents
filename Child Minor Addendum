2.	Parent represents that it is the parent or legal guardian of Minor. Parent hereby represents that it has read and agrees to the Terms on behalf of itself and Minor. 
Parent acknowledges that Minor’s permission to use the Service is conditional upon Parent’s own, additional agreement to the Terms.
